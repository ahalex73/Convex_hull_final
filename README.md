# Packages needed
Pytest - for testing functionality of convex hulls


# Use of each file
graham_scan.py - Implementation of convex hull algorithm called graham scan
monotone_chain.py - Implementation of convex hull algorithm called monotone chain scan 
jarvis_march.py - Implementation of convex hull algorithm called jarvis march scan  

generate_points.py - generates a listing of points to run for n-timing functions

parse_file.py - Allows the parsing of CSV files
    - parse_file_for_known_convex_hull(file_name.csv)

CSV's
star_text_points.csv    - contains known convex hull of star
eclipse_text_points.csv - contains known convex hull of eclipse
